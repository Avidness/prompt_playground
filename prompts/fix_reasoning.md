The {SOLUTION} you implemented failed on at least one of the examples you were provided.
Your task is to determine what the issue is and then fix the code. The issue could be a bug in the code and/or an issue with your previous understanding of the {SOLUTION}.
You'll need to carefully reason to determine the issue and to determine how to fix the code. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <fix_reasoning></fix_reasoning> tags. Then, implement the fixed {SOLUTION} in code.
I have asked you this same question before. I am showing you many of your attempts to solve this problem that were incorrect in some way. I am including your entire response, including your reasoning that led to the wrong {SOLUTION}.
Here are the examples that have failed:
...

Recall that you should start by reasoning to determine what the issue is in <fix_reasoning> </fix_reasoning> tags. Also recall that the problem could be a bug in the code and/or an issue with your previous understanding of the {SOLUTION}.
If you notice an issue with your previous understanding of the {SOLUTION}, you'll need to do further analysis (including analyzing properties of the example inputs and outputs) to determine exactly what the correct {SOLUTION} is.
Once you are done reasoning, rewrite the code to fix the issue. Return the code in triple backticks ( python and then ).
If your attempted fix fails, you'll be called again (in the same way) to continue debugging. So, if print statements would help you debug, you can include them in your code.
